## How to setup

- Run `yarn` to install dependencies.
- Run `yarn build:watch` to start webpack in watch mode.
- Open `Figma` -> `Plugins` -> `Development` -> `Import plugin from manifest...` and choose `manifest.json` file from this repo.

⭐ To change the UI of your plugin (the react code), start editing [App.tsx](src/app/App.tsx).  
⭐ To interact with the Figma API edit [controller.ts](./src/plugin/controller.ts).
